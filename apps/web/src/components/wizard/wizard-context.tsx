/**
 * Contract-creation wizard state.
 *
 * The shell (contract-wizard.tsx) owns the StepIndicator, step transitions, and
 * footer navigation; this module owns the *data* that flows across steps so each
 * step is a thin, stateless slot.
 *
 * The step sequence is not a fixed list — it forks on how the finished contract
 * is delivered. Every contract shares the lead-in:
 *
 *   upload → place fields → delivery method
 *
 * then the chosen `deliveryMethod` decides the tail:
 *
 *   'email' → recipients → review/send   (the classic path)
 *   'link'  → share link                 (generate a shareable link)
 *
 * Steps are addressed by a stable `StepKey`, never a raw index, so the branch
 * can grow or shrink without index math drifting. `state.step` is still the
 * cursor, but it indexes into `stepSequence(deliveryMethod)`.
 *
 * Steps never advance themselves: they populate state, and `canProceed()`
 * derives whether the shell's Next button unlocks. This keeps the gating in
 * one declarative place as later grains fill in their slots.
